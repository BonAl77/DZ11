    <div class="blocktext3">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing
        and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
         dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
          of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
           not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic 
           typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised 
           in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
           Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing 
           software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. 
           It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by
            the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
            The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal 
            distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content 
            here', making it look like readable English.</div>
